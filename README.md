# fabrial
A server library written in Java. 

The name comes from a device in the [Stormlight Archives](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Fabrial) series by Brendan Sanderson. Fabrials harness spiritual energy (stormlight) to accomplish different tasks. For example, [spanreed](http://stormlightarchive.wikia.com/wiki/Spanreed) fabrials harness stormlight in rubies to facilitate communication across large distances.
